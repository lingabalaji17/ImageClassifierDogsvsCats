# Cats vs Dogs Image Classifier

## Overview
This project involves the development of an image classifier that can accurately differentiate between images of cats and dogs. The classifier is trained using a deep learning model, enabling accurate predictions on new images.

## Installation
- Clone the repository: 'git clone https://github.com/lingabalaji17/ImageClassifierDogsvsCats.git'

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model contains a collection of labeled images of cats and dogs. These images are preprocessed and organized into ImageClassifierDogsvsCats
/basedata/ (training|validation|testing)

## Model Architecture
The image classifier is built using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) - Conv2D to effectively capture intricate features present in the images. The model undergoes training to learn discriminative patterns between cats and dogs.

## Results
The model achieves an accuracy of 85% on the test dataset.
